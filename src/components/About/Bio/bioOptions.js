      could see and use drove me to pursue front-end development. My first love
      is web dev with the React/MERN stack, but I enjoy learning blockchain and
      data science, AI and machine learning, and even a little game development
      and 3D graphics! I'm curently figuring out how to build stuff with
      languages like Python, Julia, Selenium, and C++. My other interests are
