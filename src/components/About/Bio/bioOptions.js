      could see and use drove me to pursue front-end development. My first love
      is web dev with the React/MERN stack. I'm curently figuring out how to build API's on the back-end with NodeJS and Express and expanding my knowledge by building fullstack React and Typescript projects. My other interests are
      powerlifting 🏋️‍♂️, photography 📸, graphic/illustrative design 🖌️, theology
